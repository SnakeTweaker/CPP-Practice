Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

The client was The Gaming Room. My objective was to implement the game "Draw It or Lose It" for Android as a cross-platform application. The client desired to improve the software capability and wanted the project to be cross-platform to all users. I was able to expound to the detail of how the program could be developed cross-platform.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I think design documents are a critical element to developing software, this helps to compartmentalize the functions of the code, and what the design constraints and capabilities hold. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I wish I could have taken my time with a lot of my efforts during this assignment and actually learn the material better. I ended up having to commit to extremely long study sessions in order to keep myself on track, which was a challenge for me. I'd improve my initial design document, instead of looking up the answers online, I should have read more into my objectives. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I split the game's functionality, reducing the work and time needed to bring it to other operating platforms. The game is still the same. Your customers may ask you to do this work, but the product is actually controlled by the user. If you do not trust the software or are experiencing problems, it will no longer be available and it will no longer be a product. You are creating a product for the customer at their expense so it must appeal to their needs.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
Clear and concise documentation is crucial to the future support and maintenance of their software. Making sure the progress that I'm making is logged, version control is also something that needs to be implemented.
